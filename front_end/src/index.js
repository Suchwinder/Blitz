/**
 * BrowserRouter is a version of react routing in order to match the
 * UI(User Interface) with the URL selected.
 * So it basically is one of many approaches 
 * to ensure what we see on the webpage matches the link we are at.
 * in other words
 * This provides the routing ability to change the URL to the 
 * appropriate link such that additional features can be loaded
 * in for our SPA(Single Page Application). It allowes the user to move backwards and
 * forwards in the webpage. Also provides deeplinking
 * where hyperlinks lead to a specific content instead of a 
 * general home page.
